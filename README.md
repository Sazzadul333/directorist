Directorist is the complete WordPress directory plugin that is used to create modern advanced directory websites. Before we started with this project, we researched and couldn't find any comprehensive directory solution out there. That's why we took initiative to make it happen in order to serve your purposes.

## EXTENSIVE MONETIZATION FACILITY
Directorist Business Directory allows you to monetize your business directory website in various ways. Letâ€™s take a look at them:

- **Featured Listing:** Earn money by featuring each of the listings of your site users according to their purchase. In this process, you make listings featured and promote them that display at the top in the listing page.
- **Paid Listing*:** Get paid for each listing your users submit! You can create unlimited pricing plans by providing different sets of values to get paid by listing the submissions. To make it happen, it requires a cost-effective premium extension.
- **Claim Listing*:** Make money by allowing business owners to claim their listing and get verified.
- **Pay Per Submit:** Earn by charging users to create a listing on your site.
